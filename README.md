Some python projects that I found interesting to share.

# B'day Guesser
One of the my first projects that made when I picked up programming at school. It wasn't exactly a programming project when I learnt about it first.
It was based on a 'Mental Math' trick my 7th grade teacher taught. 
She was the first one who introduced us to Binary No.s . She taught how to convert decimal no.s to binary no.s.In class we created B'day predictor cards based on the binary 1s and 0s. 
There were 5 cards, each with a set of dates whose binary 1s coincided with the no. of the cards. 
For example 21==>10101 in binary, hence it occupied cards 1, 3 and 5 and 31==>11111 in binary would occupy all cards.
It is a simple but quite mesmerizing in my opinion. Now I looked around and found that it is also a project in JAVA for kids project. I've automated the making of the cards.
Wanted to share this project with beginners. Do suggest to make the code more efficient. Would be happy to make changes.
